# Sample Node.js Application

This document provides an overview of a sample Node.js application, including its architecture and workflow. The application is designed to demonstrate best practices in Node.js development.

---

## Application Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the application:

    Client -->|HTTP Requests| API[Node.js API Server]
    API -->|Database Queries| DB[(Database)]
    API -->|External API Calls| ExternalAPI[Third-Party API]
```

## Workflow

The workflow of the application is depicted below:

```mermaid

    participant Client
    participant API
    participant DB
    participant ExternalAPI

    Client->>API: Sends HTTP Request
    API->>DB: Queries Database
    DB-->>API: Returns Data
    API->>ExternalAPI: Sends API Request
    ExternalAPI-->>API: Returns Response
    API-->>Client: Sends HTTP Response
```

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Built using Express.js for handling HTTP requests.
- **Database Integration**: Uses MongoDB for data storage.
- **External API Integration**: Fetches data from third-party APIs.
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling mechanisms.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale with increasing user demands.
